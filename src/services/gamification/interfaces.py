Gamification Service Interfaces

This module defines the abstract interfaces for the Diana Bot V2 gamification system.
These interfaces establish contracts for points management, achievements, leaderboards,
and anti-abuse mechanisms while ensuring bulletproof transaction integrity.

Key Features:
- Type-safe interfaces with full validation
- Atomic transaction guarantees
- Anti-abuse and rate limiting contracts
- Event Bus integration patterns
- Performance requirements enforcement
