### 6. Event Catalog (`src/core/events/catalog.py`)

#### EventCatalog
Central catalog providing authoritative mapping of:
- Event publishers and subscribers
- Service dependencies
- Event routing preferences
- Delivery guarantees
- Priority subscribers

#### ServiceName Enumeration
Complete enumeration of all Diana Bot V2 services:
- Core Services: TELEGRAM_ADAPTER, EVENT_BUS
- Business Logic: GAMIFICATION, NARRATIVE, ADMIN, MONETIZATION
- Supporting: ANALYTICS, NOTIFICATION, USER_MANAGEMENT, CONTENT_MODERATION
- Infrastructure: HEALTH_MONITOR, CONFIGURATION, AUDIT

#### EventRoute
Defines comprehensive routing information:
- Primary and secondary publishers
- Subscriber sets with priority levels
- Delivery guarantees (at_most_once, at_least_once, exactly_once)
- Persistence requirements
- Routing keys

### 7. Service Communication Patterns

#### Gamification Service
- **Publishes**: PointsAwardedEvent, AchievementUnlockedEvent, StreakUpdatedEvent, etc.
- **Subscribes to**: UserRegisteredEvent, ChapterCompletedEvent, DecisionMadeEvent
- **Dependencies**: → Notification, Analytics, User Management

#### Narrative Service
- **Publishes**: StoryProgressEvent, DecisionMadeEvent, ChapterCompletedEvent, etc.
- **Subscribes to**: UserRegisteredEvent, UserActionEvent
- **Dependencies**: → Gamification (for point awards), Analytics

#### Admin Service
- **Publishes**: UserBannedEvent, AdminActionPerformedEvent, SystemMaintenanceEvent
- **Subscribes to**: All event types for monitoring and analytics
- **Dependencies**: → Audit, Analytics, Notification

#### User Management Service
- **Publishes**: UserRegisteredEvent (via Telegram Adapter)
- **Subscribes to**: Most domain events for user state tracking
- **Dependencies**: Central service with broad event consumption

## Technical Features

### 1. Validation System
- **Strict Mode**: Production-level validation with timestamp and payload size limits
- **Normal Mode**: Standard validation for development
- **Lenient Mode**: Minimal validation for testing and mocking

### 2. Serialization Support
- JSON-compatible serialization for Redis persistence
- Type-safe deserialization with validation
- Metadata preservation across serialization boundaries

### 3. Event Type Detection
- Automatic event type generation from class names
- Category-prefixed event types (e.g., "gamification.points_awarded")
- Consistent naming conventions

### 4. Priority System
- Automatic priority assignment based on event semantics
- HIGH priority for milestones and critical business events
- CRITICAL priority for errors and administrative actions
- LOW priority for analytics and routine health checks

### 5. Backward Compatibility
- Legacy event system still functional
- Gradual migration path for existing code
- Enhanced EventFactory supporting both systems

## Integration Points

### 1. Event Bus Integration
- Compatible with existing RedisEventBus implementation
- Enhanced EventFactory supports catalog-based event creation
- Automatic event type resolution through catalog

### 2. Service Discovery
- Complete service dependency mapping
- Publisher/subscriber relationship tracking
- Circular dependency detection

### 3. Monitoring and Analytics
- Event category-based filtering
- Critical event identification
- Service health correlation through event patterns

## Usage Examples

### Creating Events
```python
from src.core import PointsAwardedEvent, UserRegisteredEvent

# Create points awarded event
points_event = PointsAwardedEvent(
    user_id=123,
    points_amount=50,
    action_type='story_chapter_completed',
    multiplier=1.5,
    source_service='gamification'
)

# Create user registration event
user_event = UserRegisteredEvent(
    user_id=456,
    telegram_data={'username': 'diana_fan', 'first_name': 'Alex'},
    referral_code='FRIEND123',
    source_service='telegram_adapter'
)
```

### Using Event Catalog
```python
from src.core import event_catalog, ServiceName, PointsAwardedEvent

# Get routing information
publishers = event_catalog.get_publishers(PointsAwardedEvent)
subscribers = event_catalog.get_subscribers(PointsAwardedEvent)

# Get service dependencies
deps = event_catalog.get_service_dependencies(ServiceName.GAMIFICATION)

# Generate routing table for external systems
routing_table = event_catalog.generate_routing_table()
```

### Event Serialization
```python
# Serialize event
event_dict = points_event.to_dict()

# Deserialize using catalog
route = event_catalog.get_route_by_event_type(event_dict['event_type'])
restored_event = route.event_class.from_dict(event_dict)
```

## Testing Coverage

Comprehensive test suite (`tests/unit/core/test_event_contracts.py`) covering:
