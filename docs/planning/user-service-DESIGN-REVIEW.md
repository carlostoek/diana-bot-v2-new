# Design & UX Review: User Service PRD (Telegram-based)

## Status: Approved

Date: 2025-08-30
Reviewer: @designer

## Summary

The revised, Telegram-based User Service PRD is approved from a design and user experience perspective. 

The architecture is designed to be **completely invisible to the user**, which is the optimal solution. The concept of zero-friction, automatic registration is fully supported.

## Key Points

-   **No User Interface:** There are no user-facing screens, forms, or interactions associated with this service. 
-   **Positive Narrative Impact:** The service will provide the user's Telegram name (`first_name`) to the narrative engine, allowing for a more personal and immersive experience when interacting with Diana and Lucien.
-   **Seamlessness:** The user should never be aware that a registration or authentication event is occurring.

## Next Steps

The design review is complete and approved. The project is clear to proceed to the implementation phase.
