### CHARACTER CONSISTENCY REVIEW
---------------------------------
**STATUS:** âœ… APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS

**ANALYSIS:**
The proposed architecture and data model provide a technically sound and flexible foundation for the Narrative Service. From a character consistency perspective, the design is strong because it does not impose technical limitations that would flatten or simplify our characters. The use of `JSONB` fields for emotional variables and conditions is particularly powerful, as it allows us to represent the complex, often non-linear, psychological states of Diana.

-   **Architecture:** The microservice approach correctly isolates narrative logic, preventing it from being diluted by other business concerns. This is good for protecting character integrity.
-   **Data Model:** The separation of static content (`scenes`, `decisions`) from dynamic user state (`user_narrative_states`) is excellent. It correctly models the world versus the user's journey within it. The `emotional_variables_impact` and `required_conditions` fields in the `narrative_decisions` table are the key to bringing Diana's personality to life, allowing her reactions to be conditional and nuanced.

However, the system's flexibility means the *content* created within this structure is what will ultimately determine success or failure in preserving character. The technology provides the stage; it does not write the play. My approval is conditional on the following recommendations being integrated into the implementation plan.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1.  **Issue:** The `character_speaker` field in `narrative_scenes` is a free-text string. This is a high risk for typos ('diana' vs 'Diana') or inconsistency, which would break immersion.
    **Suggestion:** This field should be constrained by an `ENUM` type in the database (`CREATE TYPE character_enum AS ENUM ('Diana', 'Lucien', 'System', 'NPC');`) and in the application logic. This enforces a controlled vocabulary and prevents narrative errors.

2.  **Issue:** The logic for evaluating `required_conditions` and applying `emotional_variables_impact` is the heart of the character simulation. If this logic is not sufficiently complex, Diana will feel robotic. A simple `affinity > 50` check is not enough to represent her mystery.
    **Suggestion:** The **Narrative Engine** component must be designed to handle complex, compound conditions. It should support not just greater-than/less-than checks, but also checks against the `user_decision_log` (e.g., "has the user ever lied to her before?") and paradoxical logic (e.g., "show this option only if affinity is high AND the user has recently made a 'cold' decision"). This logic must be a first-class citizen of the implementation, not an afterthought.

3.  **Issue:** The admin panel, as described, allows for real-time editing of the narrative flow. This is dangerous. An admin could inadvertently create a narrative dead-end or a loop that breaks character logic.
    **Suggestion:** The admin panel needs a **"Narrative Linter"** feature. Before an admin can save changes, this linter should run a series of validation checks:
    -   Are there any orphaned scenes (scenes with no decisions leading to them)?
    -   Does every decision lead to a valid next scene?
    -   Are there any logical contradictions in the `required_conditions`?
    This protects the integrity of the narrative experience from human error.

By implementing these recommendations, we can ensure the technical framework doesn't just *allow* for Diana's complex personality but actively *supports and protects* it.
